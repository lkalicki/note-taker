# Note Taker

## Description 

The Note Taker is designed to allow a small business owner (or anyone looking to take notes for that matter) a simple, easy to use application that organizes their notes and thoughts in a straightforward manner, leveraging Heroku and back end Express.js functionality. 

## Installation

In order to install the Note Taker application, start with the provided starter code for the front end. Then begin using Express after installing it via npm i express in Command Prompt, once you're in the correct directory. From there, it's necessary to link the HTML to get and post requests in the backend JS. Each User's not4e should have a unique ID, which can be written in the server's JSON file. From there, using post and get methods, the JSON file and server communicate in order to display the note properly, as well as delete it. 

## Usage 

To run the application, click to add a note. Once prompted, enter a title and note text, then save the note. Continue to add notes as needed, and view previously entered notes from the left-hand column. 

This application is mainly intended to store notes for organization purposes, but future enhancements could include adding checkbox functionality for to-do lists or shopping lists, as well as potentionally upgrading to add email reminders/notfications.
